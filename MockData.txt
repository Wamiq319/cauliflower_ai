Integrated Downy Mildew Control for Cauliflower

💊 Treatment Recommendations:
- Apply fungicides like metalaxyl-M or mancozeb at early signs of infection.
- Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately.
- Improve air circulation to reduce leaf wetness.

🛡️ Prevention Measures:
- Use resistant cauliflower varieties, if available.
- Avoid overhead irrigation.
- Rotate crops with non-host species (minimum 2-3 year rotation).

✅ Best Practices:
- Monitor crops regularly, especially during cool, moist weather.
- Ensure proper plant spacing to reduce humidity around leaves.

⚠️ Priority Level: High

-----------------------------------------

📌 Suggestion Title:

- Use neem oil or bio-fungicides at early disease detection.
- Apply compost tea sprays weekly during wet weather.
- Remove and bury severely infected plants.

🛡️ Prevention Measures:
- Select mildew-resistant hybrid varieties.
- Improve soil health with organic matter.
- Avoid excessive nighttime irrigation.

✅ Best Practices:
- Scout fields twice weekly during humid conditions.
- Train farmers in early disease recognition.
- Encourage intercropping to disrupt pathogen spread.

⚠️ Priority Level: Medium
